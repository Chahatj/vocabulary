## Goal
* App that will help people to improve vocabulary.

## Setup
* If you haven't installed flutter already, first install and setup flutter in your OS. 
Click on this [link](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to know more.
* After setup run the following command:
```
flutter run // Please make sure simulator or device is connected before running this command.
``` 
* So, that was it. Now you will see vocabulary app running in your simulator or device.
* Swipe up and learn a new word.
* If you know the word already, you can even click on 'I know' and you would be appreciated by the app with a 'Hurray' :).
